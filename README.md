# 2025-Remasters

# These are all games from previous years that I decided to give a little more love and fix issues. 

# Several games had long standing bugs or other problems that I wished to fix so the club didn't look foolish at the Expo Event.



# Pioneer Tanks:
# Fixed player and enemy movement so they weren't tied to the device framerate (Time.fixedDeltaTime as added to the calculation)
# Adjusted a few levels so that enemy tanks weren't immediately killing the player
# Adjusted the second level so that using bombs weren't required
# Made the large bullets more noticeably larger
# Changed Black tanks a little to make them more dangerous and more unique
# Adjusted enemy tank movement to move away from bullets and mines smarter

# RIG:
# Health pack heals to full and ravioli went from +25 to +40 health
# Added soda health item
# Added flashlight controls in inventory
# Made wackywavinginflatabletubman active again but moved it somewhere else
# Slightly reduced stamina loss from running (from 0.2 -> 0.18) and jumping (from 3.0 -> 2.8)
# Adjusted hitbox for most inventory items on the ground to make them easier to pick up
# Added more interactive prompt messages when certain events are completed
# Red lights turn to green lights on the Pipe Lever puzzle when it is completed
# Altered the death screen to make it cleaner looking. Also removed quit button in death screen.
# Added a health pack and oil hazard room to Level 1
