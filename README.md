# 2025-Remasters

# These are all games from previous years that I decided to give a little more love and fix issues. 

# Several games had long standing bugs or other problems that I wished to fix so the club didn't look foolish at the Expo Event.



# Pioneer Tanks:
# Fixed player and enemy movement so they weren't tied to the device framerate (Time.fixedDeltaTime as added to the calculation)
# Adjusted a few levels so that enemy tanks weren't immediately killing the player
# Adjusted the second level so that using bombs weren't required
# Made the large bullets more noticeably larger
