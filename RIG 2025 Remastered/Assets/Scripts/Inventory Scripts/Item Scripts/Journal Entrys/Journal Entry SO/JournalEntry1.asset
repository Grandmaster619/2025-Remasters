  journalEntry: "Day 17: Was asked to repair one o\u2019 the boats today. Dunno why,
    I\u2019ve been here a couple weeks and haven\u2019t seem \u2018em get used once.
    Does no one go home here? \u2018S a bit weird. Alex seemed chipper today, but
    not really, like fakin\u2019 it if that makes sense. Everybody in the carbon
    seemed ta brighten a little bit cuz of it though. Asked about it durin\u2019
    lunch and Alex said that none o\u2019 the bosses \u2018round here care about
    us so someone\u2019s gotta pick up the mood. Makes sense I guess."
