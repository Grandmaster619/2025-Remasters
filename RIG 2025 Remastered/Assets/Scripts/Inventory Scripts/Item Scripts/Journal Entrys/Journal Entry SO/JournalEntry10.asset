  journalEntry: "Day 140: A couple of my cabin mates have been jumpier than usual
    lately. Apparently one of \u2018em overheard the Chief on a call with someone,
    probably the big boss man. Lord knows that guy\u2019ll never take orders from
    anyone else. Apparently he overheard the Chief sayin\u2019 something about \u2018finally
    finding the [paper singed or covered in oil]\u2019 an\u2019 that they\u2019d
    get a supply o\u2019 it soon. Chief apparently sounded pretty freaked out \u2018imself,
    which doesn\u2019t bode well for us. Probably gonna have a buncha all-nighters
    for Lord knows how long now\u2026"
