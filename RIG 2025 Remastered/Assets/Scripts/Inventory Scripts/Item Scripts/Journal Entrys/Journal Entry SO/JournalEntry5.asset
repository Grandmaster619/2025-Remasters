    time writing this. Remember we all thought Avery left? Turns out, mining all
    that green stuff turned [paper singed or covered in oil] and Adrian and Jackie
    finally succumbed to [paper singed or covered in oil]. I almost threw up when
    I saw Chief\u2019s [paper singed or covered in oil]. I think I\u2019m the only
    one left. I hafta get a boat. I\u2019ve had to repair this blasted rig a billion
    times in the last year, I know I can fix the speedboat at the dock. This place
    is messed up, but the only ones I care about are here, even if they\u2019ve been

    was goin\u2019 on here. Even if no one believes me, I gotta try. S\u2019all I
    can do now. \r\nWish me luck.\r\n"
