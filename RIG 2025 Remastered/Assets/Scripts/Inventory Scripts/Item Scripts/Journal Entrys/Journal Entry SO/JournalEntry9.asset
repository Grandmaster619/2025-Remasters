  journalEntry: "Day 103: Shared lunch with Jackie, Avery, and Adrian today. Somehow
    their lunches all got stuck in the bad cabinet, n\u2019 they all got ripped apart.
    Those rats are getting worse, they tracked oil all through the lunches. One was
    even in a bag I heard, it looked drenched in oil. Heard its eyes were all messed
    up too, but I dunno if that was someone\u2019s imagination"
