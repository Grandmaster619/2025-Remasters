  journalEntry: "Day 79: Chief is gone. No one said why, but it\u2019s probably cuz
    of Alex. New guy\u2019s no better though, maybe even worse. Heard some whispers
    that he wants to stick cameras in every room so next time something like that
    happens he\u2019ll see it before it goes down. I think he just wants a way to
    make sure we\u2019re not doin\u2019 anything that\u2019ll slow down production. "
