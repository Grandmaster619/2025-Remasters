  journalEntry: "Day 21: Alex introduced me to someone in our cabin today. Been pretty
    absorbed in work so haven\u2019t really chatted with anyone but Alex tbh, guess
    that\u2019s why I basically got my tail dragged to some social thing everybody
    was doin\u2019 tonight. Was nothing fancy, just everybody huddlin\u2019 up like
    those overnight camps we all did as scouts. Anyway, Alex introduced me to Jackie,
    who\u2019s pretty cool. \u2018Parently used to work at one o\u2019 the company\u2019s
    factories but got transferred here. I didn\u2019t even know this place had other
    factories, let alone a ravioli one. Guess it explains the majority of rations
    though. Three of us are sorta buddies now, I think? Feels weird to have friends,
    but not complainin\u2019"
