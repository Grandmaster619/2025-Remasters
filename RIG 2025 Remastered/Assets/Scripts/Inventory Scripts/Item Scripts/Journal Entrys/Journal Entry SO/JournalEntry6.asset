  journalEntry: "Day 1: Rig\u2019s pretty big, but still cramped somehow. Maybe I\u2019ll
    get used to it, s\u2019only my first day. My bunkmate\u2019s alright, nice enough,
    but got all weird when the chief showed up. Chief seems alright too, a bit pushy
    about rules and stuff, but I guess that\u2019s fair. Hope things relax a bit
    once I get the hang of things. This is my last shot, job pays decent an\u2019
    I get a place to live outside that old apartment, so maybe things\u2019ll finally
    get better\r\n"
