  journalEntry: "Day 97: Avery and Adrian have been gettin\u2019 on really good,
    I swear that\u2019s the only reason that kid hasn\u2019t spiraled yet. Think
    the only reason I haven\u2019t spiraled is cuz of Alex and Jackie. Well, just
    Jackie now. Lord knows we all need that, \u2018specially with everything goin
    nuts. Swear I saw some long, black tentacle knocking on the window today, but
    the Chief said it\u2019s just a lamprey. Somehow that makes me feel worse, didn\u2019t
    know lamprey could get that big\r\n"
